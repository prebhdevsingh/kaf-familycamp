  - question: How much does it costs?
    answer: "Prices vary depending on when you book, but the aim of Khalsa Family
      Retreat is to keep costs to a minimum for delegates. We generally
      subsidise our events, with the retreat not making a profit and running on
      a loss. This is done so that families can afford to attend get the
      opportunity to attend. We seek to make up any losses through generous
      donations from the Sadh Sangat. "
  - question: I have a baby, do I have to pay?
    answer: Children who are aged 2 and under are free. Children aged between 3 and
      12-years-old will qualify for the child rate.
  - question: My child is 13-years-old - why do I have to pay adult price?
    answer: Most residential sites only offer discounted rates for children under
      the age of 12, we then pass these savings onto the families in order to
      book at cheaper rates for children. Generally sites will charge us adult
      rates for anyone over the age of 13, therefore we need to charge for them
      accordingly. Like we have mentioned before, we look to keep our costs as
      long as possible to enable as many families to be able to afford the cost
      in order to attend.
  - question: What happens with the money I pay?
    answer: Khalsa Family Retreat is run by Khalsa Foundation, a registered UK
      charity, our accounts can be found online through the charity commission
      website. All proceeds generated go towards covering the costs incurred at
      the event and into future Parchar projects by Khalsa Foundation.

      dinner and activities at Khalsa Family Retreat. You may wish to bring some
