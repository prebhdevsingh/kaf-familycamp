title: Frequently Asked Question
faqs:
  - question: "What is Khalsa Family Retreat? "
    answer: Khalsa Family Retreat is a residential event based in the UK aimed at
      getting families together to explore Sikhi in a friendly, fun, relaxed and
      non-judgemental environment. Khalsa Foundation created a residential event
      aimed at families called Khalsa Family Retreat in 2017, which looks to
      replicate the success of Khalsa Camp for the whole family, so instead of
      focusing on the individuals, the focus is switched to the whole family and
      their spirituality together. Khalsa Family Retreat consists of group
      workshops about various aspects of Sikhi and family life. The workshops
      aim to give the delegates an opportunity to explore Sikh concepts with
      their family members whilst applying it to the real world.
  - question: What is the difference between Khalsa Family Retreat and Khalsa Camp?
    answer: Khalsa Family Retreat is tailored towards families learning about Sikhi
      together and consists of a varied timetable. There are interactive adult
      workshops, classes for children, creche for the little ones learning and a
      baby creche for the very new members of the Khalsa family. Alongside this
      there are a number of family sessions which are aimed at the whole family
      conducting activities as a family unit. Khalsa Camp is a child free event,
      aimed at individuals wanting to focus on their own Sikhi whilst connecting
      with other like-minded individuals.
  - question: Who can attend Khalsa Family Retreat?
    answer: Anyone is the simple answer. Khalsa Family Retreat is open to all
      families, regardless of whether you are at the start of your journey as a
      family exploring Sikhi or very advance. It is a chance to meet other
      families who are on the same journey as you.
  - question: Are there any age restrictions to attend Khalsa Family Retreat?
    answer: There are no age restrictions in attending Khalsa Family Retreat, from
      new born babies to great grandparents, all are welcome.
  - question: Where does Khalsa Family Retreat take place?
    answer: "Generally Khalsa Family Retreat will take place in different venues
      depending on the availability and costs. For August 2024, KFR will be
      taking place in Llangrannog, Wales, and in December it will take place in
      the Midlands in Litchfield which is between Birmingham and Derby. "
  - question: Is Khalsa Family Retreat only for Sikhs?
    answer: No, anyone is welcome, from any background. Khalsa Family Retreat ethos
      is based solely on Sikhi and the Sikh way of life, to encourage everyone
      to take a step towards the Guru together. These teachings are universal
      for mankind and all are welcome to attend. If you have any questions, just
      contact us via email at kfr@khalsafoundation.org.
  - question: How much does it costs?
    answer: "Prices vary depending on when you book, but the aim of Khalsa Family
      Retreat is to keep costs to a minimum for delegates. We generally
      subsidise our events, with the retreat not making a profit and running on
      a loss. This is done so that families can afford to attend get the
      opportunity to attend. We seek to make up any losses through generous
      donations from the Sadh Sangat. For KFR the opening fee for early
      registration will be £150 for anyone over 13 years old and £90 for anyone
      under 12 years old with those under 2 attending for free. This will be for
      a limited time so register before the deadline, all the latest offers will
      be available via the registration form. "
  - question: I have a baby, do I have to pay?
    answer: Children who are aged 2 and under are free. Children aged between 3 and
      12-years-old will qualify for the child rate.
  - question: My child is 13-years-old - why do I have to pay adult price?
    answer: Most residential sites only offer discounted rates for children under
      the age of 12, we then pass these savings onto the families in order to
      book at cheaper rates for children. Generally sites will charge us adult
      rates for anyone over the age of 13, therefore we need to charge for them
      accordingly. Like we have mentioned before, we look to keep our costs as
      long as possible to enable as many families to be able to afford the cost
      in order to attend.
  - question: What support is there for my child who has neurodiversity needs?
    answer: "Whilst we are limited in being able to cater for everything, for KFR
      2023, we have made arrangements to accommodate Neurodiverse children more
      comfortably than in previous years. This will be shown in the application
      process. What this means is that we will look to cater, where possible,
      specialist session for those children who have neurodiversity needs such
      as autism, ADHD, dyslexia etc. We will have Sevadars prepare sessions
      specifically designed to engage children with neurodiversity, we Sevadars
      who have knowledge on neurodiversity leading the sessions. "
  - question: What happens with the money I pay?
    answer: Khalsa Family Retreat is run by Khalsa Foundation, a registered UK
      charity, our accounts can be found online through the charity commission
      website. All proceeds generated go towards covering the costs incurred at
      the event and into future Parchar projects by Khalsa Foundation.
